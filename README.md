# goodbuy

GoodBuy is an app that helps users reduce impulsive purchases and stay focused on achieving more meaningful long-term goals. 
By tracking wishes, thoughtful decisions, and saved amounts, it strengthens financial literacy, self-control, and a healthy relationship with money. The solution reduces the pressure of fast consumer culture among young people and encourages responsible, sustainable, and intentional financial behavior.
